 has one of the strongest correlations with Item sales.
- Other data values have little to no correlation with item sales


- All of the items appear to have the sell about 2$,500,000 across all stores
- Here we see that seafood yields the most sales per product for each grocery store
 
# Predictor Model
## Regression Metrics for the predictor
![Regression Model Metrics](https://github.com/aksalas/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/assets/95392861/9f06858f-d83b-4dd7-9be3-893fbc1f3c5e)
- We used a Random forest model to predict item sales.
- The R-Squared for the testing data is 0.59 and an MAE of 732.
- These metrics mean that our model can predict how much an item would sell with a variance of .59 from the target price.
# Reccomendations
- Further optimization is needed to reach a more desirable model that can predict sales.
